#### [Tiger, Tiger](https://www.tigertigercomic.com/)
Ludovica Bonnaire is prevented from exercising her considerable academic acumen by the opressive strictures of high society. Fortunately she's not above recruiting her loyal servants and enormous fiance into a little light fraternal betrayal in the pursuit of her research on sea sponges. Petra Nordlund weaves a deeply funny and whimsical tale of eldritch intrigue on the high seas with enchanting illustrations and witty writing. I love the characters, I love the design, and I adore the little bonus strips that add flavor to this colorful but shadowed world. Nearly every page contains one or two panels that I set as wallpapers for my phone.

This is an ongoing comic that updates at least once a week.

#### [Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/)
Sorority sister gets cockblocked by God and walks backwards into hell. Fortunately, hell is stocked with a rich cast of angels, devils, gangsters, mercenaries, ruthless and mad pretender gods, nice girls way out of their depth, and noodle vendors. Some pages look like the devilishly fascinating offspring of Where's Waldo and Hieronymus Bosch, others were yanked from the best fantasy kung fu movie that was never made. Abbadon's use of color and fanatical attention to detail make every panel a delight. Not to mention that the lore and the alt text are treats in and of themselves, full of mysticism and hidden meanings to be later revealed.

This is an ongoing comic that usually updates twice per week.

#### [\[un\]Divine](https://www.undivinecomic.com/comic/)
Depressed nerd makes a deal with a powerful demon to get out of his chores. This has no negative consequences whatsoever. Themes of family, friendship, and responsibility bind the story together. A wildly 90's color palette splashed with blood and dashed against intricate gothic cathedrals makes unDivine stick in the mind's eye.

This comic is currently on hiatus, but new pages are available on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/unDivine).
