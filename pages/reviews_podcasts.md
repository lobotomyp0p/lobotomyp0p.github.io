#### [Revolutions](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/)
Historian Mike Duncan walks us through the enterprises of great pitch and moment that have rocked western civilization over the last few centuries. I cannot name a favorite series because many of them are so good, but I would particularly highlight Mike's coverage of the Haitian, South American, and Mexican revolutions. Some of my favorite episodes are early in the current series (episodes [10.2](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/2019/05/102-the-adventures-of-karl-marx-and-friedrich-engels.html) - [10.5](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/2019/06/105-the-adventures-of-mikhail-bakunin.html)) on the Russian revolution, in which Mike carefully lays out the foundations of Russian anarchism and communism.

This podcast releases new episodes once per week and episodes are usually 30-40 minutes long.

#### [The History of English Podcast](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/)
Kevin Stroud lulls me to my rest by tracing the history of the english language from its indo-european roots to our modern tongue. To be perfectly honest, I usually listen to this podcast when I'm going to sleep (about 10 days of cumulative listening in 2019). That being said I still find the subject matter usually really interesting and in particular my favorite episode is the one where Kevin reads the middle english poem [Sir Gawain and the Green Knight](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/2019/11/25/episode-131-sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight/).

This podcast releases new episodes once per month, with bonus material available on [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/historyofenglish). Episodes are usually over an hour long.

#### [Srsly Wrong](https://srslywrong.com/)
A utopian leftist podcast that sometimes makes me cry but always leaves me with good vibes. The episode on [prison abolition](https://srslywrong.com/podcast/199-prisons-must-be-abolished/) is particularly powerful.

This podcast releases new episodes about twice per month and they are always over an hour long, sometimes over 2 hours.

#### [QAnon Anonymous](https://www.qanonanonymous.com/)
This is a podcast about the conspiracy theory that might end all conspiracy theories. It brings together tortured twitter nerds with journalists, social scientists, and leftist talking heads to try and make sense of a horrible, nonsensical thing. Occasionally the content is too stupid to bear, but usually it's at least funny. Sometimes when I listen to this podcast I can feel my neurons shutting down and going gently into that good night.

This podcast releases new episodes once a week and they are usually about an hour long. Bonus episodes are released once a week on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/qanonanonymous).
